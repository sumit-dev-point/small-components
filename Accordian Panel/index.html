                    <p>Test cricket, as the name suggests is played to ‘test’ the cricketing skills of the teams competing in it. It is considered as the most complete form of cricket as all aspects of cricket both within and outside the player’s control is involved in Test cricket.

                        A Test match is played over a duration of 5 days in which 90 overs are bowled in a day. A day is divided into 3 sessions of 2 hours each with two breaks between them. There is also a 5 minute drinks break in the middle of a session. Each team usually needs to bat and bowl for two innings each.</p>
